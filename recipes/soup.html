        <h3>Hot Soup! (but really at whatever temperature you prefer)</h3>
        <p>You may not be able to see yourself in it, but you can see it in you!</p>
        <p>Ingredients </br>
        <ul>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>I mean, back in the day they would make this with rocks ... any other non-water ingredient(s) will do!</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Instructions</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil up that water (if you're using rocks, you'll wanna get this really hot ...)</li>
            <li>Toss in everything you've got</li>
            <li>Find a comically large implement to stir with (rock soup won't delight your guests, might as well throw in some comedy)</li>
            <li>Cook for as long as your heart desires (I've heard some of the best spots have been cooking out of the same batch for a grip ...)</li>
        </ol>
